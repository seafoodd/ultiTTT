## Tech Stack & Architecture

| Layer        | Technology                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Frontend** | Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS    |
| **Realtime** | socket.io (WebSockets)          |
| **Backend**  | NestJS (modular, feature‑based),|
|              | Express.js (legacy API)         |
| **Cache**    | Redis                           |
| **Database** | MongoDB                         |
| **DevOps**   | Docker, docker‑compose, nginx   |
| **CI/CD**    | GitHub Actions                  |
| **Hosting**  | Digital Ocean Droplet           |

#### ✅ Note: The new NestJS-based API (in server-v2/) is actively in development. The legacy Express API (server/) remains functional until the migration is complete.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone --branch dev https://github.com/seafoodd/ultiTTT.git
cd ultiTTT
```

### 2. Copy & configure .env files in root, client/, and server-v2/

```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your values

##### if you run the app with docker-compose.dev.yml, then you only need these env variables in server-v2/.env (because other ones will be overwritten):

```env
# Brevo (Sendinblue) API key and sender email
BREVO_API_KEY=your-brevo-api-key
BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL=no-reply@example.com
```

### 3. Development with Docker

Bring up all services:

```bash
docker‑compose ‑f docker‑compose.dev.yml up --build
```

- **client** on `http://localhost:5173`
- **server** on `http://localhost:5000`
- **server-v2** on `http://localhost:5001`

### 4. Running Locally without Docker (optional)

#### Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Backend

legacy api:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

v2 api:

```bash
cd server-v2
pnpm install
pnpm run start:dev
```

##### (you'll also have to set up mongodb and redis, I used docker containers for them before I started using dev docker-compose)

---

## Production

1. Build containers:

   ```bash
   docker‑compose build
   ```

2. Start in detached mode:

   ```bash
   docker‑compose up ‑d
   ```

3. Check logs:

   ```bash
   docker‑compose logs ‑f
   ```

Database backups are managed automatically via the scripts in the `scripts/` directory and run with cron.

---

## CI/CD & Backups

**GitHub Actions** workflows live in `.github/workflows/`

On each push to `main`, we:

1. Run tests
2. Deploy to DigitalOcean droplet

---

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a topic branch (`git checkout -b feature/awesome`)
3. Commit your changes & push
4. Open a Pull Request against `dev`
5. Ensure all GitHub Actions pass
